"""Python wrapper around the ``_cpu_moe`` C++ executor (--moe-strategy cpu).

Owns the persistent CPU worker pool, the per-batch-size pinned IO buffers, and
the per-(layer, batch-size) host-func task descriptors. ``decode`` issues the
whole CUDA-graph-capturable sequence on the current stream:

    D2H (hidden, topk_ids, topk_weights -> pinned)
      -> submit host node (cudaLaunchHostFunc: enqueue MoE task to the pool)
      -> sync host node   (cudaLaunchHostFunc: spin until the pool drains)
      -> H2D (pinned expert output -> GPU)

Buffers and tasks are allocated lazily per batch size. GraphRunner runs an eager
``model.forward()`` at each batch size immediately before capturing it, so the
first (eager) call materializes the stable pinned buffers + task pointers that
the subsequent capture embeds in its host/memcpy nodes.

# Flag-based GPU<->CPU handshake for hybrid/cpu decode. The default host-func path
# (cudaLaunchHostFunc submit+sync per layer) pays ~30-50us of callback dispatch latency
# per call with the GPU stream idle -- 2 calls per MoE layer per decode step (~6 ms/step
# on a 75-layer model). Instead the GPU raises a mapped-pinned "ready" flag at submit; a
# persistent CPU coordinator (in _cpu_moe) polls it, runs the layer, and sets a "done"
# flag the GPU waits on at sync -- no host-func round-trip. Both GPU-side operations are
# STREAM MEMORY OPERATIONS (cuStreamWriteValue64 / cuStreamWaitValue64, resolved from the
# driver at runtime): they execute on the GPU front end with no SM-resident kernel, so
# GPU utilization stays truthful during the CPU compute window. (The first cut used a
# spin-wait kernel; that pinned reported utilization at 99% and laptop CPU/GPU dynamic
# power schedulers responded by clamping the CPU frequency -- a net decode regression on
# power-coupled edge devices.) Each (layer, decode batch size) pair gets its own flag
# slot, so every captured decode graph rides the handshake. Where memops are unavailable
# (Windows WDDM, vGPU, old drivers -- functionally probed at startup) or the slot
# capacity is exceeded, decode keeps the host-func path (functional, slower). A Python
# watchdog thread turns a wedged coordinator into a loud RuntimeError (via err[] +
# raise_if_unhealthy) instead of an indefinite stream stall.
